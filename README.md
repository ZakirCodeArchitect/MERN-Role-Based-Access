# MERN Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

This project is a backend authentication system built with the MERN stack, designed for educational applications. It supports role-based access control (RBAC) with roles such as `admin`, `user`, and `manager`, allowing specific features to be restricted based on the user's role.

- üîë **User Authentication**: Register and log in with JWT for session management.
- üõ° **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict access based on roles.
- üîí **Protected Routes**: Middleware to control route access by role.
- üóù **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage using bcrypt.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Consistent, secure API responses.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt
